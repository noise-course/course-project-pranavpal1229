Project Title 
AI-Assisted Imputation for Incomplete Network Traffic Data 
Project Summary 
In network traffic analysis, packet capture (PCAP) files are the foundation for studying 
communication patterns, performance metrics, and anomaly detection. We often see these 
packet captures holding incomplete or missing data points due to packet loss or incomplete 
logging, which can distort feature extraction and model accuracy. This project investigates how 
artificial intelligence can reconstruct missing values within PCAP-derived datasets compared to 
traditional row-deletion methods. By exploring AI-assisted imputation, we aim to retain more 
information from partially captured sessions and improve downstream analytics accuracy. In 
essence, can we use AI to find the patterns within the data before using the data to predict 
future patterns.  
Data 
The dataset will be generated from PCAP files collected during controlled network sessions of a 
user interacting with a target software application (e.g., web app or streaming platform). 
Features such as packet size, inter-arrival time, source/destination IP, and protocol type will be 
extracted using tools like Wireshark. Missingness will be introduced to simulate packet loss and 
incomplete capture conditions. We hope that the data is incomplete when we gather it but will 
need to make it intentionally incomplete if this does not work.  
Machine Learning 
We will test multiple imputation strategies: 
● AI-based methods: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation, linear/logistic regression.  
● Baseline: Simple deletion (listwise removal) and mean/median substitution. 
After imputation, standard ML classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees) will be 
trained on both versions of the dataset to assess how imputation affects predictive performance. 
Evaluation 
Model performance will be compared using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and mean 
squared error on held-out validation data. 
Learning Objective 
Often we simply take out outliers or incomplete data, but this leads to us missing out on 
potential data points that have important features in other columns. Being able to use AI to 
complete data will allow us to see if we can harness a stronger dataset to predict network 
capabilities/features better.
